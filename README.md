## What is "cson2yaml"

cson2yaml is a node.js module that turns CSON/JSON into YAML and [RAML](http://raml.org/)

It uses [xcson](https://github.com/awnist/xcson) under the hood to provide an extensible cson format.

## Why?

Because writing RAML sucks when your project gets large. Look at the xcson docs and see what you can do with the format.

## Installation

Use [npm](http://www.npmjs.org/).

    $ npm install cson2yaml

Otherwise, you can check cson2yaml into your repository and expose it:

    $ git clone git://github.com/awnist/cson2yaml.git node_modules/cson2yaml/

cson2yaml is [UNLICENSED](http://unlicense.org/).
